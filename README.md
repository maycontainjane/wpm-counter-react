## Some tiny React practice

Hopefully a small enough app that I can finish it up in a couple of days and refresh myself on React!

## Things Have Changed

Some of the things I want to learn and practice are:
- using function definitions instead of class defitions for components
- hooks! What are those? Let's use them!
- reminder of how data is passed between layers of React
- new things like classnames
- if possible, expansion could include another simple app and react-router to move between them

## Thanks Create-React-App!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
